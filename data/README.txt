CHALLENGE 01 - DATA & REPORTING GAPS
Sample dataset (synthetic)

Three extracts covering 01-Jul-2026 to 30-Jul-2026, taken from three
different systems the way an operations team receives them today.

  01_his_admissions_discharges.csv   HIS admissions/discharge export
  02_lab_order_to_result.csv         Lab order-to-result turnaround log
  03_bed_occupancy_manual.csv        Manually maintained bed occupancy sheet

OPEN THESE PROGRAMMATICALLY, NOT IN A SPREADSHEET.

Read them with pandas, R, or whatever you are comfortable with. Spreadsheet
software will silently reinterpret the date columns on open - the three
files each use a different date format on purpose, and Excel in particular
will guess at DD/MM vs MM/DD without warning you and rewrite the values if
you save. If you do open one to look around, close it without saving.

(Columns showing ######## in a spreadsheet are only too narrow to display.
The file itself is fine - widen the column.)

THESE FILES DO NOT AGREE WITH EACH OTHER.

That is intentional and is the substance of the challenge. The
disagreements are all reconcilable, but you must decide how, and state the
rules you applied. Do not silently drop rows that conflict.

Things worth checking before you model anything:
  - each file writes dates in a different format
  - the same ward is named differently in each file
  - patient identifiers are prefixed in one file and bare integers in another
  - some lab orders belong to patients with no admission record
  - some rows are duplicated, some values are blank, some have stray spaces
  - the bed sheet's occupancy does not always agree with the admissions
    ledger for the same date, and some days were never filled in at all

All data is synthetic. It contains no real patient or staff records.
